0) slider controls with integral spaced movement
1) better importing of graphical javascript controls, instead of copy+paste
	can't do this yet :(
2) better cockpit as a standalone webui for some module
	maybe: http://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/embedding.html ?
3) cross compilation from golang to js
	maybe: https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs ?
